# Roulette Game

This project is a simple implementation of a roulette game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a rotating roulette wheel and a bouncing ball that follows the laws of physics.

## Project Structure

- `src/index.html`: Main HTML file that sets up the structure of the roulette game.
- `src/css/styles.css`: Styles for the roulette game, including layout, colors, and animations.
- `src/js/game.js`: Entry point for the game logic, managing the game loop and user interactions.
- `src/js/wheel.js`: Class representing the roulette wheel with methods to draw and rotate it.
- `src/js/ball.js`: Class representing the ball with methods to draw and update its position.
- `src/js/physics.js`: Functions implementing physics calculations for the ball's movement.
- `tests/game.test.js`: Unit tests for the game logic.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm.
