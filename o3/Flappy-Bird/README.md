# Flappy Bird with Mario

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of a Flappy Bird-style game using Mario as the main character. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes the HTML5 Canvas for rendering.

## Game Mechanics
- The player controls Mario, who must navigate through a series of obstacles.
- The player can make Mario "flap" by pressing the spacebar or clicking the mouse.
- The objective is to avoid the obstacles and achieve the highest score possible.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML document that sets up the game structure.
- **css/style.css**: Contains styles for the game, including layout and animations.
- **js/app.js**: The main game logic, handling user input, game state updates, and rendering.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Use the spacebar or mouse click to control Mario and navigate through the obstacles.

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects and background music.
- Implement different levels with increasing difficulty.
- Include a scoring system and display the score on the screen.
